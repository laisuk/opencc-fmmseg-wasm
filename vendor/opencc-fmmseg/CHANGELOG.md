## [0.13.1] - Unreleased

### Changed

- Cleaned up Rust Clippy warnings across the core library and C API without changing runtime behavior.
- Improved C API safety contracts by marking FFI functions that require caller-enforced pointer validity as
  `unsafe extern "C"`, with clearer `# Safety` documentation.
- Preserved all exported C ABI symbols, signatures, and compatibility with existing language bindings.
- Refined internal code to address Clippy suggestions while preserving performance-sensitive logic.
- Applied narrowly scoped Clippy allowances where appropriate to retain upstream vendored code and existing API designs.
- Updated Rust tests to respect the explicit FFI safety contracts.

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-09

### Breaking

- `save_cbor_compressed()` is now gated behind the `dictionary-build` feature. Applications that generate
  Zstd-compressed CBOR dictionary artifacts must explicitly enable `dictionary-build`, for example
  `opencc-fmmseg = { version = "0.13", features = ["dictionary-build"] }`. Runtime dictionary loading remains available
  without this feature and uses the built-in pure-Rust Zstandard decoder.

### Added

- Added Seal script conversion support based on the upstream OpenCC Seal dictionaries.
- Added direct Rust conversion APIs for Seal workflows:

    - `OpenCC::seal2s()` for Seal → Simplified Chinese.
    - `OpenCC::seal2t()` for Seal → Traditional Chinese.
    - `OpenCC::s2seal()` for Simplified Chinese → Seal.
    - `OpenCC::t2seal()` for Traditional Chinese → Seal.
- Added strongly typed `OpenccConfig` variants and string-config dispatch for the new Seal conversions.
- Added Seal dictionary slots to the public dictionary model, allowing Seal mappings to participate in the existing
  custom-dictionary append/override workflow.
- Added cached starter unions for Seal conversion paths, reusing the existing `StarterUnion` / `UnionCache` architecture
  and avoiding per-conversion union construction.
- Added C API configuration constants and conversion support for the new Seal configs.
- Added C API round-trip and regression coverage for Seal conversions.
- Added Rust regression tests covering direct Seal conversion helpers, config dispatch, dictionary references, cached
  unions, and conversion round trips.
- Added documentation for Seal conversion configs, public APIs, dictionary slots, CLI usage, and custom-dictionary
  integration.

### Changed

- Optimized `StarterUnion` construction for astral starters by deriving per-starter caps directly from existing length
  metadata instead of repeatedly rescanning dictionary keys. This removes a long-standing quadratic initialization cost
  exposed by the large Seal character set and also benefits existing conversion paths with astral dictionary keys.
- Corrected long custom-dictionary key handling at the 64-scalar boundary and above, including length enumeration,
  multi-dictionary gating for BMP and astral starters, mixed short/long starter metadata, and debug validation. The
  existing 255-scalar maximum remains unchanged.
- Extended the internal conversion-plan and dictionary-reference infrastructure to support Seal conversion while
  preserving the existing cached-union conversion path.
- Reordered the new Seal configuration numbers into their final public ordering before release, keeping the Rust
  `OpenccConfig` values and C API configuration constants aligned.
- Clarified the naming of internal Seal conversion helpers so conversion direction and intermediate conversion stages
  are explicit.
- Updated bundled OpenCC dictionary data with the Seal dictionaries and regenerated the embedded dictionary artifact.
- Replaced the native Zstandard runtime dependency for embedded dictionary loading with a specialized pure-Rust decoder
  adapted from `ruzstd`.
- Trimmed the internal Zstandard decoder to the functionality required by OpenCC, while preserving compatibility with
  legacy frames without a frame content size (FCS). When FCS is available, it is used for bounded output preallocation,
  and decoded data is drained directly into the final buffer to reduce allocation and copying.
- Kept the native `zstd` dependency optional under the `dictionary-build` feature for dictionary generation. Newly
  generated embedded Zstandard artifacts now include FCS metadata.
- Updated CLI configuration parsing and help output to include the new Seal conversion configs.
- Updated public documentation and examples to reflect Seal support across the Rust API, C API, CLI, and
  custom-dictionary system.
- Updated dictionary data and Unicode Compatibility mapping table.
- core: estimate parallel chunk capacity in UTF-8 bytes.
- CAPI: deprecate redundant conversion API variants.

---

## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Updated dictionary data.
- Added more entries to the Unicode compatibility mapping table.
- Reduced CBOR and readable JSON dictionary sizes by omitting redundant `starter_len_mask` metadata when
  `key_length_mask == 1`. Deserialization reconstructs omitted masks from Unicode scalar keys, including non-BMP
  characters, while preserving explicitly stored masks in older artifacts. Phrase and mixed-length dictionaries retain
  their serialized starter masks; runtime storage, lookup behavior, `StarterUnion`, and `UnionCache` are unchanged.
- For the current embedded `STCharacters` dictionary, uncompressed CBOR shrinks from 58,897 to 37,665 bytes (~36%),
  and compact readable JSON from 82,992 to 49,717 bytes (~40%). Generated dictionary artifacts are not regenerated.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for CBOR/JSON field omission, legacy artifacts, exact phrase and mixed-length masks,
  supplementary-plane characters, runtime lookup metadata, starter unions, and existing dictionary conversion
  round-trips.
- Verified with Rust 1.75.0, including the full library test suite, dictionary-generator tests, and ignored dictionary
  generation and CBOR/Zstd round-trip tests.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Added allocation-reuse DeTofu APIs: `OpenCC::detofu_into(...)` and `DetofuMap::detofu_into(...)`, allowing callers to
  append results into an existing `String` buffer while reusing allocations across multiple conversions.
- Expanded the built-in DeTofu fallback data to cover rare non-BMP characters produced by both Simplified-to-Traditional
  and Traditional-to-Simplified conversion, with direction-independent display-compatible fallbacks.
- Added curated Unicode compatibility normalization backed by `Unicode_Compatibility.txt`, covering selected CJK
  radicals, glyph variants, punctuation forms, and text-extraction artifacts while preserving one-Unicode-scalar-to-one-
  Unicode-scalar mappings.
- Added `OpenCC::normalize_unicode_compat(...)` for applying only the curated Unicode compatibility table.
- Added `OpenCC::normalize_compat_extended(...)` for combined CJK Compatibility Ideograph and curated Unicode
  compatibility normalization.
- Added C API support for compatibility normalization and DeTofu through `opencc_normalize_compat(...)`,
  `opencc_normalize_compat_extended(...)`, and `opencc_detofu(...)`, with ABI-stable `OPENCC_DETOFU_EXT_B` through
  `OPENCC_DETOFU_EXT_I` threshold constants.

### Changed

- Unified all direct Rust conversion helpers on the `(input, punctuation)` signature. The `t2tw`, `t2twp`, `tw2t`,
  `tw2tp`, `t2hk`, `t2hkp`, `hk2t`, `hk2tp`, `t2jp`, and `jp2t` helpers now optionally apply Traditional-style
  punctuation conversion, matching the existing direct Simplified/Traditional APIs. The signatures of `convert(...)`
  and `convert_with_config(...)` are unchanged.
- Made the `opencc_fmmseg` crate root the single public entry point for the dictionary API. The `dictionary_lib`,
  `dictionary_maxlength`, and `starter_union` implementation modules are now private, while their supported public types
  are available directly from the crate root.
- Internalized `StarterUnion`, its constructor, and its lookup tables. Union construction and caching are
  conversion-engine implementation details and no longer constrain future internal refactoring.
- Made `DictMaxLen` storage, bounds, masks, starter indexes, and matching gates crate-private. Public callers now use
  safe pair construction/mutation plus read-only `get`, `iter`, `len`, `is_empty`, `min_key_len`, and `max_key_len`
  accessors.
- Refactored `dict-generate` JSON conversion to rebuild all derived metadata from semantic key/value pairs instead of
  reading or writing `DictMaxLen` internals. Removed its now-unused direct `rustc-hash` dependency.
- Updated docs.rs links, rustdoc examples, and README guidance to use only the crate-root public paths.
- Migration: Rust imports through nested paths such as
  `opencc_fmmseg::dictionary_lib::DictMaxLen` must be changed to crate-root imports such as `opencc_fmmseg::DictMaxLen`.
- `opencc_fmmseg::dictionary_lib::StarterUnion` has no public replacement; callers should use the high-level `OpenCC`
  conversion APIs, which construct and cache the required union metadata internally.
- The `compat_ideographs` and `unicode_compat` modules, their reusable normalizer types, and their normalization free
  functions are no longer publicly exposed. The supported public normalization API is
  `OpenCC::normalize_compat(...)`, `OpenCC::normalize_unicode_compat(...)`, and
  `OpenCC::normalize_compat_extended(...)`.
- Replaced the TS-specific DeTofu data with the unified `CharactersTofu.txt` fallback table, reflecting DeTofu's broader
  ST + TS coverage.
- Refactored DeTofu around a shared, lazily initialized built-in fallback table backed by
  `OnceLock<FxHashMap<...>>`. Built-in mappings are now initialized only once and reused by all conversions.
- Redesigned `DetofuMap` to store only custom override mappings while sharing the immutable built-in fallback table,
  substantially reducing initialization overhead and memory usage.
- Optimized built-in DeTofu conversion with a dedicated fast path while preserving custom override precedence.
- Made `OpenCC` the primary public DeTofu entry point for normal conversion workflows, while retaining `DetofuMap` as
  the reusable and customizable advanced API.
- Internalized the standalone `detofu(...)` and `detofu_into(...)` helper functions. Built-in DeTofu remains available
  through `OpenCC`, while standalone or custom-map use cases are supported through `DetofuMap`.
- Extended compatibility normalization without changing the existing `OpenCC::normalize_compat(...)` behavior; callers
  can opt into the broader curated normalization with `OpenCC::normalize_compat_extended(...)`.
- Updated conversion dictionary data.

### Breaking

- Direct Rust calls to `t2tw`, `t2twp`, `tw2t`, `tw2tp`, `t2hk`, `t2hkp`, `hk2t`, `hk2tp`, `t2jp`, and `jp2t` must now
  pass a `punctuation: bool` argument. Pass `false` to preserve the previous behavior. Configuration-based
  `convert(...)` and `convert_with_config(...)` calls require no source changes.
- The standalone Rust `detofu(...)` and `detofu_into(...)` functions are no longer public. Use `OpenCC::detofu(...)`
  and `OpenCC::detofu_into(...)` for normal conversion workflows, or `DetofuMap::detofu(...)` and
  `DetofuMap::detofu_into(...)` for reusable or customizable standalone DeTofu processing.

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated v0.11.4 Japanese slot-name aliases
  `JPShinjitaiCharacters`, `JPShinjitaiCharactersRev`, and
  `JPShinjitaiPhrases`, as announced for the 0.12.x release series. Use the canonical `JPSCharacters`,
  `JPSCharactersRev`, and `JPSPhrases` slot names. The physical `.txt` dictionary filenames are unchanged.

---

## [0.11.5] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added C API support for constructing immutable converters with in-memory custom dictionaries through
  `opencc_new_custom()`.
- Added ABI-stable C types and constants for custom dictionary pairs, specifications, all 21 dictionary slots, and
  append/override modes. Input arrays and UTF-8 strings are validated and copied during construction.
- Added custom-dictionary support to the header-only C++ RAII helper, together with C and C++ examples, ownership
  guidance, validation documentation, and regression tests.
- Added and embedded updated reverse Taiwan variant phrase dictionary data.
- Added `DictSlot::ALL`, `DictSlot::canonical_name()`, and
  `DictSlot::from_name_ignore_ascii_case()` as the single source of truth for enumerating, displaying, and parsing
  public dictionary slot names.

### Changed

- Updated Simplified/Traditional and Taiwan phrase dictionary data and regenerated the embedded CBOR/Zstd dictionaries
  and packaged native libraries.
- Updated the Windows C API headers, import library, demos, and example binaries for the custom-dictionary API.
- Bumped the Rust workspace crates, C API crate, and Python package to
  `0.11.5`, and refreshed locked dependencies including `regex`, `serde`, and
  `serde_json`.
- C API: Optimized `opencc_lst_error()` handling.

### Fixed

- Fixed canonical custom-dictionary slot parsing for Japanese Shinjitai dictionaries. `DictSlot::try_from()` now accepts
  `JPSCharacters`, `JPSCharactersRev`, and `JPSPhrases`, matching the documented SSOT slot names and shared CLI parsing.
- Preserved the v0.11.4 Japanese filename stems `JPShinjitaiCharacters`, `JPShinjitaiCharactersRev`, and
  `JPShinjitaiPhrases` as deprecated parsing aliases. They will be removed in the 0.12.x release series; physical
  dictionary filenames remain unchanged, and names including the `.txt` suffix are not accepted as slot identifiers.

---

## [0.11.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added direct Hong Kong phrase conversion APIs `OpenCC::t2hkp()` and
  `OpenCC::hk2tp()`, together with the `t2hkp` and `hk2tp` string configs and
  `OpenccConfig::{T2hkp, Hk2tp}` typed configs. The new stable C/FFI config IDs are `19` and `20`, respectively.

### Changed

- Update dictionary data.
- Refactored direct Taiwan phrase conversions `t2twp` and `tw2tp` from two dictionary rounds to one by sharing the
  combined `TwTriple` and
  `TwRevTriple` starter unions. Removed the obsolete phrase-only union caches.
- Generalized the Hong Kong phrase union caches to `HkTriple` and
  `HkRevTriple`. The new direct `t2hkp` and `hk2tp` conversions reuse these combined unions in one dictionary round and
  do not require a punctuation parameter.

---

## [0.11.3] -2026-07-08

### Changed

- Updated embedded dictionary data.
- Update conversion dictionary data.
- Updated DeTofu character mappings.
- Resolved ambiguous DeTofu fallback mappings using preferred BMP replacement characters.

---

## [0.11.2] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added optional CJK Compatibility Ideograph normalization for callers that want a Unicode compatibility pre-pass before
  OpenCC segmentation/conversion.
- Added `src/data/CJK_Compatibility_Ideographs.txt` mapping data.
- Added `compat_ideographs.rs` with cached dense lookup tables.
- Added `OpenCC::normalize_compat(...)` convenience API.
- The feature is optional and does not affect normal conversion unless explicitly used.
- CLI: `opencc-rs` - added `--norm-compat` feature.

---

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added optional IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence) preservation support:
    - `OpenCC::get_preserve_ids()`
    - `OpenCC::set_preserve_ids(bool)`
- Added `opencc-rs convert --keep-ids` to preserve complete IDS expressions during conversion.
- Added `opencc-rs convert/office --custom-dict` to use custom dictionary during conversion.
- Added IDS parser and validation helpers for detecting complete Unicode IDS sequences.
- Added regression tests covering unary, binary, ternary, nested, and malformed IDS expressions.

### Changed

- Update dictionary data.
- Refactored text segmentation to optionally isolate complete IDS sequences before conversion.
- Refactored serial and parallel conversion paths to share the same text segmentation logic.
- When IDS preservation is enabled, complete IDS expressions are emitted unchanged while incomplete IDS expressions
  continue to be processed normally.
- Optimized `office_converter` for error handling.
- Extracted `DeTofu` section from `README.md` to standalone `DETOFU_USER_GUIDE.md`

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Added public DeTofu display-compatibility fallback APIs for rare non-BMP CJK extension characters:
  `DetofuLevel`, `DetofuMap`, `detofu()`, `OpenCC::detofu()`, and
  `OpenCC::detofu_with_custom_file()`.
- Added `DetofuMap::with_custom_pairs(...)` for applying in-memory DeTofu fallback pairs after loading built-in
  mappings.
- Added `OpenCC::detofu_with_custom_pairs(...)` convenience API for applying built-in DeTofu mappings plus custom
  in-memory fallback pairs.
- Added support for loading user-supplied DeTofu fallback files. Custom mappings are merged with the built-in fallback
  table, and custom entries take precedence when duplicate tofu-risk characters exist.
- Added docs and README examples for threshold-based DeTofu levels, direct utility usage, reusable maps, custom fallback
  files, and post-load custom fallback pairs.
- Added tests for DeTofu custom pairs, built-in override behavior, and later-pair-wins behavior.
- Added upstream-compatible Hong Kong phrase conversion configs `s2hkp` and
  `hk2sp`.
- Added optional HK phrase dictionary slots `HKPhrases` and `HKPhrasesRev`.

### Changed

- Mirrored upstream OpenCC Japanese dictionary naming by replacing the old
  `JPVariants` / `JPVariantsRev` model with `JPShinjitaiCharacters.txt`,
  `JPShinjitaiCharactersRev.txt`, and `JPShinjitaiPhrases.txt`. Custom dictionary users should use the
  `JPSCharactersRev` slot instead of the removed `JPVariants` slot.
- Refactored `s2twp` to match the upstream OpenCC config restructure:
  the Taiwan phrase mappings and Taiwan variant mappings now run together in the second conversion round after the
  Simplified-to-Traditional round. This preserves OpenCC-compatible output while removing one full conversion pass.
- Reduced the size of the built-in DeTofu fallback table by switching extension identifiers from `ExtB`–`ExtI` to the
  compact form `B`–`I` while maintaining backward-compatible parsing support for both formats.
- Improved DeTofu parser compatibility to accept both compact (`B`–`I`) and legacy (`ExtB`–`ExtI`) extension identifiers
  in custom fallback files.
- Missing plaintext `HKPhrases.txt` and `HKPhrasesRev.txt` files now load as empty dictionaries for backward
  compatibility with older dictionary folders.

### Breaking

- Removed the old Japanese custom dictionary slots `JPVariants` and
  `JPVariantsRev`. Use `JPSCharactersRev` and `JPSCharacters` respectively.

---

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added upstream-aligned forward regional phrase dictionaries:
    - `TWVariantsPhrases.txt`
    - `HKVariantsPhrases.txt`
- Added public custom dictionary slots:
    - `DictSlot::TWVariantsPhrases`
    - `DictSlot::HKVariantsPhrases`

### Changed

- Updated and optimized dictionary data to reduce conversion ambiguity and improve phrase consistency.
- Taiwan and Hong Kong forward regional variant conversion now applies phrase-level variant dictionaries before
  character-level fallback:
    - `TWVariantsPhrases` -> `TWVariants`
    - `HKVariantsPhrases` -> `HKVariants`

---

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Updated and optimized dictionary data to reduce conversion ambiguity and improve phrase consistency.
- Improved internal last-error state handling by normalizing empty error strings (`""`) to `None`.
- Unified Rust and C API last-error behavior for more consistent FFI error retrieval semantics.

### Fixed

- Fixed rare edge cases where `opencc_last_error()` could return inconsistent results between Rust and C API layers when
  the last error state was empty.
- Fixed ambiguous internal `Some("")` last-error states that could cause fragile unit test behavior in certain
  scenarios.

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Added advanced custom dictionary support for `DictionaryMaxlength`:
    - `from_dicts_custom()` for pair-based custom dictionary injection.
    - `from_dicts_custom_files()` for loading one or more OpenCC-style plaintext dictionary files.
    - `from_dicts_at()` for loading dictionaries from an alternate base directory.
- Added new public custom dictionary APIs:
    - `CustomDictSpec`
    - `CustomDictFileSpec`
    - `CustomDictMode`
    - `DictSlot`
- Added append/override merge modes for slot-aware custom dictionary injection.
- Added support for multi-file custom dictionary layering per slot.
- Added `OpenCC::from_dictionary()` for constructing an `OpenCC` instance directly from a custom `DictionaryMaxlength`.
- Added `dict-generate -b/--base-dir` for generating CBOR/ZSTD/JSON artifacts from external OpenCC dictionary
  directories.
- Added regression tests covering:
    - pair-based custom dictionary injection
    - file-based custom dictionary injection
    - multi-slot custom dictionary loading
    - end-to-end conversion override behavior
- Added post-load custom dictionary customization APIs for already loaded `DictionaryMaxlength` instances:
    - `DictionaryMaxlength::with_custom_dicts()` for applying in-memory custom pairs after loading built-in or external
      dictionary data.
    - `DictionaryMaxlength::with_custom_dict_files()` for applying one or more OpenCC-style plaintext custom dictionary
      files after loading.
- Added dynamic `DictMaxLen` map update helpers that rebuild length metadata and starter indexes after custom pair
  updates, keeping runtime conversion fast and immutable after `OpenCC::from_dictionary()`.

### Changed

- Refactored plaintext dictionary loading internals to reuse a shared OpenCC dictionary parser implementation.
- `DictionaryMaxlength::from_dicts()` now internally delegates to the custom dictionary loading pipeline while
  preserving backward compatibility.
- Update conversion dictionary data.
- Added regression coverage to ensure `OpenCC::convert()` and the `opencc-rs convert` file-to-file path preserve the
  caller's original line endings (`CRLF`, `LF`, or mixed input) instead of normalizing by platform. This is important
  for cross-platform use cases where converted text must keep stable diffs, checksums, generated files, and repository
  line ending policy intact.
- Clarified the custom dictionary workflow as:
  `DictionaryMaxlength::from_zstd()` / `deserialize_from_cbor()` / `deserialize_from_json()` → `with_custom_dicts()` /
  `with_custom_dict_files()` → `OpenCC::from_dictionary()`.

---

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Updated conversion dictionary data.
- Replaced `once_cell` with Rust std `OnceLock`.
- C API:
    - Added `opencc_convert_cfg_mem_len()` for explicit-length UTF-8 input.
    - Improved buffer-based conversion for high-performance interop scenarios.
    - Retained `opencc_convert_cfg_mem()` for backward compatibility.
    - No C ABI break.

### Fixed

- Rust API: successful conversions now clear stale `OpenCC` last-error state, so `convert()`, `convert_with_config()`,
  and direct conversion helpers no longer leave a previous error visible after a later successful call.
- Rust API internals: `StarterUnion` now preserves true per-starter caps for custom dictionary entries longer than 64
  characters, keeping public `dictionary_lib` behavior consistent with `DictMaxLen` metadata and avoiding unreachable
  long-key matches.
- C API / C++ RAII helper: invalid config ids and names are now surfaced as native `Invalid config: ...` errors instead
  of being silently normalized to `s2t` in `OpenccFmmsegHelper.hpp`.
- C++ RAII helper: native conversion failures are now returned as last-error text instead of collapsing to empty
  strings, making wrapper behavior consistent with the underlying C API.
- C API headers: moved canonical public headers to `capi/include/` for clearer packaging and user-facing include layout.
- C API header: corrected `opencc_set_parallel` to accept a mutable instance pointer in `opencc_fmmseg_capi.h`, matching
  the actual mutating behavior and Rust implementation.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- Optimized `OpenccConfig` with added functions.
- Update dictionary
- Python demo package optimization
- Micro-optimization for `dictionary_lib`
- Improved core conversion performance by reducing heap memory allocations.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-09

### Breaking changes

- Removed the embedded `dictionary_maxlength.cbor` from the published crate
- `from_cbor()` no longer loads an embedded dictionary and now requires an external CBOR file
- Applications relying on implicit embedded CBOR must migrate to `from_zstd()` or explicit CBOR loading

### Changed

- Updated built-in dictionary to **v1.2.0**
- The crate now ships **only** `dictionary_maxlength.zstd`
  (Zstd-compressed CBOR) as the default dictionary artifact

### Added

- `from_zstd()` as the recommended default dictionary loader for non-custom usage
- Detailed migration guidance in API documentation

### Improved

- Crate size significantly reduced by eliminating redundant embedded artifacts
- Packaging and distribution behavior made explicit and deterministic

---

## [0.8.5] - 2026-01-27

- C API: added library ABI number and version string functions:
    - `opencc_abi_number()`
    - `opencc_version_string()`
- Update dictionary to v1.2.0
- Refactored `OpenCC` struct to standalone crate `opencc` with no public API changed.

---

## [0.8.4.2] - 2026-01-05

### Changed

- C API: added helper functions for OpenCC configuration name / ID mapping:
    - `opencc_config_name_to_id()`
    - `opencc_config_id_to_name()`
- Enables clean, allocation-free Name ↔ ID conversion for bindings (C / C++ / C# / Python / Java)
- C API: align deprecated `opencc_convert_len()` error behavior with
  `opencc_convert()` / `opencc_convert_cfg()`.

### Notes

- No breaking changes
- Rust core unchanged

---

## [0.8.4.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Improved C API error handling and UTF-8 validation.
- Clarified and hardened size-query semantics for `_mem` APIs.
- No behavior change for valid UTF-8 inputs or supported configs.

---

## [0.8.4] - 2025-12-31

### Changed

- Refactored `DictionaryError` into structured variants:
    - `IoError(io::Error)`
    - `CborParseError(serde_cbor::Error)`
    - `LoadFileError { path, lineno, message }`
- Replaced all string-based errors with rich underlying error types.
- Improved error messages surfaced through `Display` and the C API `opencc_last_error()`.
- Updated dictionary loading/serialization functions (`from_zstd`, `from_cbor`, `load_compressed`, `load_dict`,
  `serialize_to_cbor`)
  to use the new unified error model.

### Added

- Added strongly typed Rust API:
    - `OpenccConfig` enum (`#[repr(u32)]`) with stable numeric values.
    - `OpenCC::convert_with_config()` as the recommended, non-string dispatch path.
- Added numeric-config C API:
    - `opencc_config_t` (`uint32_t`) with ABI-stable constants.
    - `opencc_convert_cfg()` for conversion without string-based config parsing.
- Preserved legacy string-based APIs (`OpenCC::convert(&str, ...)`, `opencc_convert(...)`) for backward compatibility.

### C API Improvements

- Clarified ownership and lifetime rules:
    - Returned strings are always NUL-terminated and must be freed with
      `opencc_string_free()`.
    - Numeric config parameters are passed by value and require no allocation or cleanup.
- Standardized error behavior:
    - Invalid configs return a readable error string (e.g. `"Invalid config: 9999"`) and also populate
      `opencc_last_error()`.
- Deprecated unused length-based conversion entry points (planned removal in a future release).

### Developer Notes

- The numeric-config API is recommended for:
    - FFI bindings (C / C++ / C# / Java / Python)
    - Performance-sensitive code paths
    - Avoiding runtime string validation
- Header-only C++ helper (`OpenccFmmsegHelper.hpp`) updated to provide RAII-safe lifetime management and typed-config
  usage on top of the C API.

---

## [0.8.3] – 2025-10-20

### Added

- **Global key-length mask**: `DictMaxLen::key_length_mask (u64)`  
  Encodes presence of lengths `1..=64` (bit `n-1` → length `n`) for fast global gating (`has_key_len()`).
- **Per-starter length mask**: `DictMaxLen::starter_len_mask (FxHashMap<char, u64>)`  
  Exact per-starter length presence for BMP **and** astral chars. Dense BMP tables are rebuilt from this.
- **Adaptive pre-chunking** in `segment_replace_with_union()` for large input strings.  
  Automatically computes optimal parallel chunk sizes based on CPU count and text length.  
  Improves Rayon task distribution and minimizes overhead for long texts (e.g., 3 M chars in ~35 ms).  
  The pre-chunk allocator now precomputes total output capacity to reduce `String` reallocations.

### Changed

- **Mask-first gating** in `starter_allows_dict()`:
    - For `1..=64`, test the bit in `first_len_mask64` (or sparse `starter_len_mask`).
    - For `>64` (BMP), fall back to `first_char_max_len` (derived during build).
- **populate_starter_indexes ()** now prefers `starter_len_mask` (single pass) and falls back to scanning `map` if
  empty.
- **Pre-chunking logic** restructured for **sequential-safe range building** using
  `get_split_ranges(inclusive = true)`.  
  The number of subranges is reduced while maintaining delimiter safety, improving throughput and reducing peak
  memory.  
  The pre-allocation phase now computes cumulative chunk lengths before Rayon processing begins.
- **Docs.rs** updated across the module (examples, helpers, dense/sparse behavior).
- **CBOR I/O** now uses `serde_cbor` (`from_slice` / `to_vec`). *No format change.*

### Removed

- **`starter_cap`** from `DictMaxLen` and JSON/CBOR.  
  Dense `first_char_max_len` is derived from masks at build/load time.  
  Older serialized files containing `starter_cap` remain compatible (unknown field is ignored).

### CLI / JSON export

- `dictionary_maxlength.json`:
    - **Removed:** `starter_cap`
    - **Added:** `key_length_mask`, `starter_len_mask` (string keys → `u64` values)
- CBOR/JSON inspector script updated to summarize the new masks.

### Migration

- Replace any `starter_cap` usage with:
    - `dict.has_starter_len(c, len)` (precise for `1..=64`), or
    - `dict.first_char_max_len[u as usize] >= len` (dense BMP; covers `>64`).
- If you previously serialized `DictMaxLen` directly to JSON (which failed due to `[char]` keys), use DTOs:
  `DictionaryMaxlengthSerde` / `DictMaxLenSerde`.
- Update tests to assert **semantic invariants** (mask coverage, min/max consistency) instead of file byte sizes.

### MSRV / Tooling

- **Rayon pins for MSRV 1.75**: `rayon = 1.10.x`, `rayon-core = 1.12.x`.
- **Release toolchain** pinned to **Rust 1.82.0** (avoids Windows AV heuristics).

### Verification

- Round-trip CBOR test via `serde_cbor::from_slice` validates:
  `max_len`, `key_length_mask`, and representative `map.len()` counts.
- Benchmarks confirm stable performance:
    - 3 M chars converted in **~35 ms** (C API via Qt C++ client).
    - No observable memory spike thanks to pre-chunk preallocation and mask-based gating.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-10-02

## Added

- **dict-generate JSON export**: Human-readable JSON via DTOs with String keys;  
  supports `--pretty` (pretty) and `--compact` (default). Core schema remains CBOR/Zstd. Why: JSON is for
  reference/debug only; the canonical on-disk format stays CBOR.
- Added `min_len` field to `DictMaxLen`

### Fixed

- **EPUB**: Resolved `os error 267` (“The directory name is invalid”) on Windows by correctly handling ZIP **directory
  entries** during extraction (create directories instead of calling `File::create` on them).
- **PPTX**: Resolved `os error 5` (“Access is denied”) caused by overwriting while the input archive handle was still
  open and/or the destination file was read-only:
    - Unzip now occurs in a **scoped block** so all input handles are dropped before writing output.
    - Output writing uses **temp-file → rename** strategy to the final path.
    - Clears the **read-only** attribute on existing outputs before removal.
    - Prevents **input==output** collisions via canonical path check.

### Changed

- **EPUB packaging**: Ensure `mimetype` is written **first** and **Stored** (no compression), per EPUB spec.
- **PPTX targeting**: Process only **slides** and **notes slides** XML parts; skip `.rels` and unrelated files to avoid
  unintended edits.
- **Path safety & robustness**:
    - Added zip-slip/root component checks on extraction.
    - Walkers only operate on **files** (skip directories and non-file entries).
    - More descriptive I/O errors now include the failing **path**.
- **Cleanup**: Removed sleeps and all debug code from the conversion path.
- **Dictionaries**: Updated word lists.
- **Delimiter handling**:
    - Removed unused `Minimal` and `Normal` modes, leaving only `Full`.
    - Dropped the private `delimiters` field in `OpenCC`; now uses the global static `FULL_DELIMITER_SET`.
- **Error handling (unified)**: `from_zstd()`, `from_cbor()`, `serialize_to_cbor()`, `deserialize_from_cbor()`, and
  `new()` now return `Result<_, DictionaryError>` for consistent typed errors.

## Moved

- `serde (JSON) overrides`: Removed from core `DictMaxLen`; JSON adaptation now lives only in the `dict-generate` CLI
  (DTO layer). **Result**: Core CBOR/Zstd schema stays stable (snake_case), faster loads, less risk of format drift.

### Performance

- Optimized `zho_check()` to scan only the first **1,000 bytes** of the input string.
- Reduced runtime memory footprint by:
    - Changing `first_char_max_len`, `bmp_cap`, and `astral_cap` value types from `u16` to `u8`.
    - Updating corresponding `Vec<u16>` containers to `Vec<u8>`.
    - Safe since maximum dictionary lengths are always `< 255`.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-08-25

### Changed

- opencc-clip CLI now use clap format as command arguments.
- Retained legacy convert_by ()

### Fixed

- Lock rayon at 1.10.0, rayon-core at 1.12.1 for rustc 1.75.0 compatible.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- `DictMaxLen` helpers: `build_from_pairs`, `ensure_starter_indexes`, `populate_starter_indexes`, `is_populated`, plus
  custom `Serialize`/`Deserialize` and `Default`.
- Starter-index accelerators in `DictMaxLen`:
    - `first_len_mask64` (BMP starter → 64-bit length bitmask; bit 63 = ≥64),
    - `first_char_max_len` (BMP per-starter max length),
    - persisted `starter_cap` (non-BMP per-starter caps).
- **`StarterUnion`**: unions length masks & caps across multiple `DictMaxLen` tables (dense BMP arrays + sparse astral
  maps). `StarterUnion::build` added.
- Core FMM routine **`convert_by_union`**: longest-match using `StarterUnion` to prune impossible lengths before probing
  dictionaries.
- **Union cache** (runtime-only) inside `DictionaryMaxlength` using `OnceLock`:
    - module `dictionary_maxlength/union_cache.rs`,
    - `UnionKey` enum and `union_for(&self, key) -> Arc<StarterUnion>`,
    - `clear_unions(&mut self)` to reset cache.
- **Round orchestration refresh**:
    - `DictRound { dicts, max_len, union }`,
    - `DictRefs::new(..., Arc<StarterUnion>)`, `.with_round_2(...)`, `.with_round_3(...)`,
    - `DictRefs::apply_segment_replace` now passes `&StarterUnion` to the closure.
- Conversion entrypoints updated to use per-round unions (same external names/behavior):
    - `s2t`, `t2s`, `s2tw`, `tw2s`, `s2twp`, `tw2sp`,
      `s2hk`, `hk2s`, `t2tw`, `t2twp`, `tw2t`, `tw2tp`,
      `t2hk`, `hk2t`, `t2jp`, `jp2t`.

### Changed

- Moved `DictMaxLen` to its own module/file (`dict_max_len.rs`).
- `segment_replace` now builds **one** `StarterUnion` per call and reuses it across segments; parallel path uses Rayon
  with `.with_min_len(8)` and `reduce(String::new, …)` for fewer allocations.
- Expanded doc comments throughout (`from_zstd`, `from_dicts`, union APIs, FMM routine) and fixed doctests (explicit
  generic in `serde_json::from_str`, valid JSON without comments).

### Performance

- Significant speedups from starter masks + union pruning + cached unions.
    - Local runs (reference): ~3M chars in ~60 ms (first run), ~50 ms on subsequent runs thanks to the warm union cache.

### Breaking changes

- `DictRefs` API now requires a per-round `Arc<StarterUnion>` and the
  `apply_segment_replace` closure signature is:
  `Fn(&str, &[&DictMaxLen], usize, &StarterUnion) -> String`. (SemVer note: breaking changes are allowed in `0.y` minor
  versions.)

### Internal

- New internal helper `for_each_len_dec` (descending length enumeration with CAP bit) with overflow-safe shifting.
- `DictionaryMaxlength::unions` marked `#[serde(skip, default)]`; included in `Default` and reset in `clear_unions`.
